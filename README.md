debos Disk Image Configs
========================

These are some example configuration files and notes around how to easily build
Debian (and derivatives) disk images using the
[debos](https://github.com/go-debos/debos) tool.

You'll need at least debos version 1.0.0+git20201203.e939090-4, which if you're
using Debian is the version which ships in the bullseye Debian release.
